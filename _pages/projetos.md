### IDINA - Inclusive Non-Authoritative Digital Identity  
<img src="/images/idi.png" width="300">
- **Funding:** IN3+ Innovation Award 
- **Role:** Coordinator
- **Summary:**
    The main objective of this project is to create a non-authoritative digital identity system in order to reach populations of countries where more than 1 billion people do not possess a legal identity document. The main scientific challenges are related to information security and privacy of sensitive data.

### FLEXCOMM - Towards Energy-aware Communications: Connecting the power grid and communication infrastructure
- **Funding:** FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia
    - Project reference: EXPL/CCI-INF/1543/2021
- **Role:** Coordinator
- **Summary:** This project aims at designing and developing technologies to enable interoperability between communication networks and power distribution systems. Based on this integration, routing protocols capable of adapting data transmission to the energy flexibility and source will be designed and assessed. The rationale is to give priority to network sections powered by renewable energy as a green network strategy.
